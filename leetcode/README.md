## Some tips and tricks when leetcoding
# Array
- `XOR` operator can be used to filter out unique element. Example: [Single Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number/)
- 2 pointers / 2 indices can also be placed at 2 end of the array instead first and second index. Especially when the array is sorted. Example: [Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/)
- If output is not depend on index, then there is a high chance that we should sort the array first.
